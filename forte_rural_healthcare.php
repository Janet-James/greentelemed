				<h3 class="content_sub_heading">Rural Healthcare Infrastructure:</h3>
				
				<p>In rural settings, the quality of Primary Health Care is restricted.  For many, they are the point of entry in to the health system. </p>
				
				<p>Standard of care in Rural Areas presents a challenging picture for health system as a whole. </p>
				
				<img class="image-wrap fr" style="width:70%" src="pages/images/forte/rural_concept.png" alt="rural_concept" />
				
				<ul>
					<li>Poor health infrastructure</li>
					<li>Non availability of qualified personnel</li>
					<li>Delays in government response to health proposals</li>
					<li>A disease centric focus instead of  a person centered approach</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>An intersective use of technology that caters to local contextual needs can incorporate holistic solutions in healthcare to effectively revitalise the health system.</p>
				
				<p>The healthcare landscape while on a fast paced track towards adoption of emerging technologies also needs to focus on integration of different stakeholders. Different associations review for upgrades in healthcare and innovation assumes a significant part to encourage this. </p>

				<h3 class="content_heading">Rural Healthcare Electrification and Network Facilitation</h3>
				<p>Worldwide the healthcare industry is engaged robustly in utilizing versatile innovative systems to plug the gaps in health services administrations.</p>
				<p>Health providers in rural settings face challenges in the form of poor infrastructure and unreliable energy resources. Refrigerators and electronic medical diagnostic tools require a power source. Vaccines, blood, cold chain-dependant supplies, storage of anti-retro viral drugs are all dependent on an undisrupted power supply. </p>
				
				<p>An appropriate source of reliable and sustainable energy is essential to operate a health facility in rural settings. Power requirement to operate equipment is surveyed under normal working conditions and a range of electrification options such as solar, wind, reciprocating engine, and hybrid systems is considered. Long term sustainability is factored in by the 
				possibility that energy demands may increase due to drive in volume, extended working hours, or new services.</p>
				
				<p>Health facilities at a level where basic minimum care is provided require limited medical equipment - the energy demand is low in these units. Based on the type and number of medical devices used in the health facility, energy demands rise. </p>
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-md-6">

				<p>Options for electrification:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Photo Voltaics</li>
					<li>Wind</li>
					<li>Generators</li>
					<li>Hybrid Systems</li>
					<li>Grid Extension</li>
				</ul>
				
				<img class="image-wrap fr" style="width:50%" src="pages/images/forte/rural.png" alt="rural" />
				
				<p>Renewable energy options (e.g., photovoltaic (PV) system or Solar Energy) have higher capital costs than fuel-based power options. But in the long-term, renewable systems have lower operating costs and a friendly environmental footprint. On the downside, these systems require maintenance. </p>
				<p>A hybrid system comprising a PV system and a traditional generator have a higher capital cost than a renewable-only system; however, hybrid systems provide flexibility, including the ability for one system to support the other.</p>
				<p>Training local personnel is essential in the servicing and maintenance of these systems or obtaining a long-term maintenance contract.</p>
			
				<h3 class="content_heading">Mobile Health Units and IVR Technology</h3>
				<p>Mobile Health Units equipped with essential drugs, medical devices and laboratory equipment, can move from one place to another, providing healthcare services to the underserved communities. These units can be quickly deployed to areas in the event of calamities like floods, earthquakes, epidemic outbreaks, etc. </p>
				<p>Portable and IVR services are ideal sustainable solutions in rural settings and particularly suited for the demography.  Our focus takes into account health services, inclusive of social aspect to achieve markets at base of the pyramid. </p>
				<p>GREEN TeleMed have constructed straightforward advances on portables to suit the requirements of various areas and verticals. By enhancing the frameworks and elements of our customers we have significantly made a change to a large number of lives in Papua New Guinea. Through IVR administrations we have a broad span over the demography. Our drive is centered on conveying best practices and answers for our partners when engaging the rural markets and provides a stage for them. </p>
